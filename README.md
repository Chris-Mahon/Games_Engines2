CA1 for Game Engines 2

The basic idea for this will be to create a 2 scene simulation of a battle. Scene 1 will be the aerial combat component for it while Scene 2 will be a ground battle. 
2 motherships fighting against each other, both with the capablilities to spawn smaller ships to fight. Both of these ships will have limitations to what they are capable of doing, ie limited amount of smaller ships and men. Once either of these ships runs out of ships or nearly runs out of health, they will begin descending to the planet below.

Scene 2 will be a ground battle that is already in action as the ships above fight. Once the conditions to reach this scene are met, the motherships will descend to the planet to dispense of more troops equal to the amount of spare men on the ship. Which ever ship was forced to descend will be the first to arrive on the surface to provide additional support to their ground troops, and potentially swing the balance of the ground battle.
