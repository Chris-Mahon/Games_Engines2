CA1 for Game Engines 2

The basic idea for this will be to create a 2 scene simulation of a battle. Scene 1 will be the aerial combat component.
2 motherships fighting against each other, both with the capablilities to spawn smaller ships to fight. Both of these ships will have limitations to what they are capable of doing, ie limited amount of smaller ships and men. Once either of these ships runs out of ships or nearly runs out of health, they will begin descending to the planet below.
